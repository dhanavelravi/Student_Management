About My Project:

The Student Management System is a web app developed with Spring Boot. It uses MVC architecture and key Spring technologies. Components include a data model class, controller for handling requests, a service layer with business logic, and a repository interface for CRUD operations. HTML templates include pages for the main landing, displaying students, adding details, success message, and project information. The project is a foundation for a student management system with basic CRUD functionality.
